##### Introduction

Here is my exploratory analysis of Instacart’s sales data. The goal is to help the sales and marketing teams optimize campaign timing, product promotions, and customer segmentation. Topics of interest include peak order times, spending behavior, product popularity, brand loyalty, and demographics.

---

##### Model

The analysis is structured around seven core business questions:

1. **Peak Order Timing**  
   - Weekends are the busiest days.  
   - Peak hours are between 9 AM and 11 AM.  
   - Recommendation: Schedule ads during quieter weekday hours and introduce weekday promotions.

2. **Spending Behavior by Time of Day**  
   - Highest spending occurs during the morning rush hour.  
   - Top-selling products include produce, dairy, eggs, and snacks.  
   - Recommendation: Promote these items during peak hours or introduce bulk packaging options to increase basket size.

3. **Brand Loyalty Distribution**  
   - Returning customers are primarily middle-income and married.  
   - Recommendation: Offer discounts on premium products to attract higher-income customers and incentivize occasional buyers.

4. **Ordering Habits by Loyalty Status**  
   - Most orders come from low spenders; high spenders are less active.  
   - Recommendation: Decide whether to increase frequency among low spenders or deepen engagement with high spenders.

5. **Regional Ordering Differences**  
   - Western and Southern regions dominate sales.  
   - Recommendation: Launch regional promotions in underperforming areas to stimulate demand and appeal to cost-conscious consumers.

6. **Age and Family Status Correlation**  
   - Majority of orders are placed by married adults.  
   - Recommendation: Introduce family-sized packaging to better serve this segment and increase order volume.

7. **Demographic Classifications**  
   - 75% of customers have dependents; 61% are classified as youth.  
   - Recommendation: Focus on family-oriented products to align with core customer needs, reduce friction, and boost satisfaction.
