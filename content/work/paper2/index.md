##### Intro

In August of 2025, I began the my work on the ClimateWins project in order to help predict various weather patterns across all of Europe. Here is an overview:

Goal 1: Detect Unusual Weather Patterns Across Europe
- Using AI to identify weather events that deviate from historical regional norms
- Integrating data from satellites, sensors, and climate databases

Goal 2: Track Shifts in Weather Trends
- Applying trend and time-series analysis to measure changes in frequency and intensity
- Pinpointing patterns that may signal increasing climate volatility

Goal 3: Forecast Future Climate Scenarios (20–50 Years)
- Emulating physical climate models using advanced neural networks
- Simulating possible futures based on current emissions and socioeconomic pathways
- Generating probabilistic forecasts to support long-term planning

##### Models

In order to achieve our goals, we used a variety of models, most notably:

- Hierarchical Clustering: uses clustering to categorize

- Random Forest: uses a random sample of decision trees to categorize

- General Adversarial Network (GAN): Uses artificially produced data to categorize

- Convolution Neural Network (CNN): Uses pre-defined layers to categorize

##### Solutions

Solution 1

● Unlocking Insights with Hierarchical Clustering
– Traditional classifications of weather as "typical" or "atypical" offer limited value. By leveraging
hierarchical clustering, we can uncover deeper, actionable categorizations that better inform
decision-making.

● Approach and Results
– To maximize the impact of this analysis, we propose expanding the modeling strategy. Specifically:
– Apply the clustering model across multiple years, seasons, and months to observe temporal
patterns and variations
– Use the clustering outcomes to enhance and inform other, more definitive modeling frameworks
– This multi-layered approach allows us to go beyond surface-level labels and toward meaningful,
operational insights.
– 3 unique clusters were identified for most relevant weather stations

Solution 2

● Forecasting Future Weather with GAN-Driven Modeling
– By synthesizing weather data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we can train Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) to forecast potential weather conditions over the next five decades. This integrated
modeling approach offers a pathway to informed long-term climate strategy.

● Approach
– To validate this methodology, we recommend the following steps:
– Acquire radar datasets as recommended and apply Bayesian optimization for model tuning
– Train the optimized CNN using synthetic data generated by the GAN
– Evaluate performance and variability across different years, countries, and regions

● Results
– Bayesian optimization significantly enhanced model accuracy—from 12% to 74%—demonstrating the
effectiveness of this hybrid strategy that with tweaks can get up to 90% at the minimum


Solution 3

● Using Random Forest Optimization to Guide Safe Living Decisions
– By optimizing a random forest model, we can identify key weather features that significantly impact safety and
well-being. This insight allows us to pinpoint regions with favorable living conditions, particularly as climate
patterns evolve.

● Approach
– To strengthen the reliability of this methodology, we propose:
– Running model optimization across additional stations and extended time frames
– Applying the optimized model to extreme weather datasets
– Comparing model outputs with healthcare metrics to explore correlations with human wellbeing

● Results
– Accuracy increased from 59.1% to 67.3% when evaluating all stations
– Accuracy decreased from 100% to 85% at a single station, correcting overfitting in the unoptimized model
– Running both versions of the model revealed the relative importance of weather features in climate analysis
